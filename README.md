Python Keylogger – Windows 11 (64-bit)

Educational & Cybersecurity Research Project

This project is a Python-based keyboard input monitoring demonstration developed for Windows 11 64-bit systems. It is intended strictly for educational purposes and cybersecurity research in controlled environments.

The project demonstrates how keyboard event listeners work at the OS level to help learners understand how monitoring software operates — and how to defend against it.
